    "* If you own a stock, buying a put option on the stock will greatly reduce your risk. This is the idea behind portfolio insurance. To illustrate, consider a stock that currently sells for $56 and has an annual volatility of 30%. Assume the risk-free rate is 8%, and you estimate that the stock’s annual growth rate is 12%.\n",

Use simulation to estimate the probability distribution of the percentage return on your portfolio over a one-year period. Can you see why this strategy is called a portfolio insurance strategy?\n",

    "* The standard deviation of returns, which measures the risk or volatility of the investment, is lower for the portfolio with the put option (29.88%) compared to the stock alone (34.03%). This reduction in volatility is a key feature of insurance—by accepting a lower mean return, you're also reducing your exposure to downside risk.\n",
    "The essence of a portfolio insurance strategy lies in its ability to limit losses without entirely forfeiting the potential for gains.\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Without the put option, you're fully exposed to the stock's volatility, leading to a higher potential return but with greater risk.\n",
    "With the put option, you've effectively set a floor (the exercise price of 50) on how much you can lose over the year. If the stock's value drops below this price, the put option will offset the losses beyond this point. This safety net comes at the cost of the option premium ($238), which is why the mean return on the insured portfolio is lower.\n",
    "* By buying a put option, you're insuring the portfolio against significant losses, hence the term \"portfolio insurance.\" This strategy is particularly appealing to investors who seek to participate in the potential upside of the stock market while protecting themselves against severe downturns."
